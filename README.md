Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
----------------------------------------

The original zipped archive for this project, 'UCI HAR Dataset.zip', is unzipped and placed in 'data.in' directory. Original code book 'features_info.txt' is included for reference.
 
The project contains the following scripts: 'run_analysis.R'. It reads input data and creates the tidy data set 'tidy.dat'.

For details of the scrip, please, see CodeBook.md

Please, note in order to run the scripts 'data.in' directory should be present. This directory is not submitted to this repo.

To run type:

> R < prepare_data.R --no-save

the output is 'tidy.dat'
